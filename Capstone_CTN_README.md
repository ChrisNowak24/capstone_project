# CapstoneProject

This is Chris Nowak's Capstone Project for General Assembly, DSI Immersive class-5.

It's on Texas water and population capacity.

Executive Summary

Problem Defintion
Which large Texas city will be predicted to run out of water the fastest?  The five largest cities in Texas are Houston, Dallas, Ft Worth, San Antonio, Austin.

Background
The state of Texas has only one natural lake or water source, that being Lake Caddo in northeast Texas.  All other water supplies are lakes or man made.  Texas has three major rivers the Red River, the Colorado river and the Rio Grande.  Texas has 254 counties and approximately 121 reservoirs supplying the state with water.  Texas has some counties with the largest growth rates in the country.  The Texas climate being on the warm side and Texas being a pro business state will lead to a collision of eventually running out of water.  This study looks to predict that collision point.
